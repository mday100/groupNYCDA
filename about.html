	<p>A couple questions.</p>

	<p>1.  Have you ever gone to a restaraunt and looked at a lobster tank and felt sorry for the little guys?</p>

	<p>2. When you or someone is cooking a lobster do you ever stop to think "Hmm, how would I feel if I were about to be put into a pot of boiling water while still alive?"</p>

	<p>3.  Have you ever looked at a lobster and said "aww how cute"?</p>

	<p>If you answered yes to any of these questions then you're eligible to join us in saving the lobsters!</p>

	<p>This site was created to make our group, called the Lobster Savers, larger.  Our group is against all those people who order 25 of the little creatures and boil them while still alive on holidays. Our group is against people who have the heart to cook those poor suckers.  We're against all people who eat only a tiny peice of the lobster and say "I'm full" after just MURDERING them.</p>
