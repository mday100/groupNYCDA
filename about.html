	A couple questions.

	1.  Have you ever gone to a resturaunt and looked at a lobster tank and felt sorry for the little guys?

	2. Whenever your or sombody is cooking a lobster do you ever stop to think "Hmm, how would i feel if i were about to be put into a pot of boiling water while i was still alive?"

	3.  Have you ever looked at a lobster and said "aww how cute"?

	If you answered yes to any of these questions then you are eligible to join us in saving the lobsters!

	 

	This site was created to make our group, called the lobster savers, larger.  Our group is against all of those people who order 25 of the little creatures and boil them while they are still alive on holidays. Our group is againts all of those people who have the heart to cook the poor suckers.  Our group is against all of the people who eat only a tiny peice of the lobster and then say "I'm full after they just MURDERED them.
